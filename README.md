# REQkit 1.3.X

Run REQkit through CMD, or use a shortcut.
>_reqkit.exe --help norarg_
 
Run this for more info. noarg can be literally anything because i'm stupid and I didn't _really_ know how to use click at the time

Lets you buy and sell REQ packs/REQs in halo 5 (a dead game lol).
too lazy to continue improving this, but it works pretty consistently.
